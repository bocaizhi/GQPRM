# Query-based Graph Data Dynamic Pricing for Revenue Maximization

Query-based graph data pricing is promising to price each subgraph separately in graph database to accommodate data combinations for needs of diverse users. However, owing to the fundamental challenge in balancing broker revenue against transaction success rate during data price updates, existing methods fail to address the vital requirement of precise updating of data pricing. We propose GQPRM, a dynamic query-based graph data pricing framework, including:
(1) We introduce a vertex-edge pricing mechanism for broker to determine the price of subgraph when it is first queried by a buyer. The mechanism is theoretically proven arbitrage-free.
(2) For repeatedly queried subgraphs, the broker has to find the way to update each subgraph price on each query. We model this pricing task as a multi-armed bandit problem and adopt an exploration-exploitation strategy driven by historical price variations of the subgraph to balance high broker revenue with high transaction success rate.
(3) Furthermore, we employ entropy weight method integrating centrality, query frequency and transaction success rate as parameters to distinguish the contribution weight of each vertex and edge to the latest price change.
Experiments demonstrate $\mathbf{GQPRM}$ significantly outperforms static pricing methods in both broker revenue maximization and transaction success rate.
